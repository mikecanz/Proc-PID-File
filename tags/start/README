WHAT IS IT
==========

This is a module to manage *nix pid-files, which are files that store
a process identifier. A script (usually a daemon) can create a pid-file to
check whether it is already running, so it can avoid creating multiple
instances of itself.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============

Just type:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

and you should be all set.

HOW TO USE
==========

For the usage, please consult the man page provided with this package.
