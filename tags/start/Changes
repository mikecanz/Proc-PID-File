Revision history for Perl extension Proc::PID::File.


0.05 Wed Jan 23 01:09:28 2002
	- remove mtime stuff
	- interface change, now non-OO

0.04 Thu Jan 10 21:08:34 2002
	- instead of $pid->active only returning 1 for true, it will simply
	  return the pid of the active process. Since the pid will never be 0,
	  active will still be true and work as documented. (thanks to Paul
	  Baker)

0.03 Wed May 23 01:23:40 2001
	- make the module work under -T (HASANT)
	- make the module work with forking servers -- child processes's DESTROY
	  now won't delete the pid file (Brad Hilton)

0.021 Mon Oct 30 20:49:20 2000
	- change method of getting file's age from -M to stat() because -M
	  returns a negative number on Solaris for files < 1 day old (reported
	  by Tom Leoboldt)

0.02  Wed Sep  6 17:24:52 2000
	- interface change
	- added a test suite

0.011 Thu Aug 03 06:40:00 2000
	- package wrapping fix (The tarball had been wrapped incorrectly.  All
	  of the files in Proc-PID_File-0.01/Proc/ should be at the top level)

0.01  Mon Jul 31 06:59:56 2000
