1.26 2009/10/01 01:35:02 - Erick Calder <e@arix.com>
	- implemented fixes for Cygwin support of PID verification.

	  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=50078
	- fixed problem with low $COLUMNS values in certain platforms
	  (ps output wraps) - thanks to JDHedden for the patch.  see:
	  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=15015
	- defaulted values to avoid:
	  Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//)
	- implemented taint checking patch at:
	  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=6347
	  thanks to JDHedden for the patch
	- Reinstated OO interface to solve Clinton Gormley's need for
	  maintaining multiple PID files, one for each child process
	- Documentation: added example of specifying a directory for the
	  pidfile, as per enquiry by Milko Krachounov; added a newline for
	  debug() function as per David Hawthorne so avoid run-on sentences
	  in output

1.25 2009/06/29 17:41:00 - Mike Canzoneri <mikecanzoneri@gmail.com>

      Thanks Nigel!

1.21 2003/06/03 18:10:14 - ekkis
    - changed version system to manual updates
    - added dependency code/docs for "ps"
    - documented that the name verification string passed to the simple
      interface is used as a regexp
    - ps output now parsed for COMMAND matching only
    - Thanks to alan <alan@pair.com> for his continued support.

1.6 2003/05/30 23:14:39 - ekkis
    - verify() now takes a string to allow the user to supply the command
      to be matched against

1.5 2003/05/30 22:42:41 - ekkis
    - added verification of pids using qx/ps/ to avoid bootup problem
    - modified docs, added standard stuff, included warning

1.4 2003/05/29 05:35:23 - ekkis
    - implemented running() to avoid race conditions into a new
      simple interface.  Thanks to Alan Ferrency <alan@pair.com>
      for pointing it out and suggesting the solution

0.05 Wed Jan 23 01:09:28 2002
	- remove mtime stuff
	- interface change, now non-OO

0.04 Thu Jan 10 21:08:34 2002
	- instead of $pid->active only returning 1 for true, it will simply
	  return the pid of the active process. Since the pid will never be 0,
	  active will still be true and work as documented. (thanks to Paul
	  Baker)

0.03 Wed May 23 01:23:40 2001
	- make the module work under -T (HASANT)
	- make the module work with forking servers -- child processes's DESTROY
	  now won't delete the pid file (Brad Hilton)

0.021 Mon Oct 30 20:49:20 2000
	- change method of getting file's age from -M to stat() because -M
	  returns a negative number on Solaris for files < 1 day old (reported
	  by Tom Leoboldt)

0.02  Wed Sep  6 17:24:52 2000
	- interface change
	- added a test suite

0.011 Thu Aug 03 06:40:00 2000
	- package wrapping fix (The tarball had been wrapped incorrectly.  All
	  of the files in Proc-PID_File-0.01/Proc/ should be at the top level)

0.01  Mon Jul 31 06:59:56 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
