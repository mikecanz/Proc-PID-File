WHAT IS IT

This Perl module is useful for writers of daemons and other processes that
need to tell whether they are already running, in order to prevent multiple
process instances.  The module accomplishes this via *nix-style I<pidfiles>,
which are files that store a process identifier.

HOW TO INSTALL

Just type:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

...and you should be all set.
